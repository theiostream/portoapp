Under development! A couple of things:
1. Huge commits. Really, huge commits. Please don't be mad at me, it's just that during these early add-a-fuckton-of-stuff development stage, I just lose track of what I'm working on and when I see I've implemented a whole new stage of what I was planning. So yeah, sorry :(

2. Huge file. Use vim and foldings to make sense out of this.

3. Send me complaints about the code! I'd like to hear from you! (If something is very very ugly, don't worry, I've most likely noticed it and am working on it.)

4. Licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.
