UPDATE AS OF 26/1/2013
See history/JAN_2013.txt

As of now, that this app is feature-complete, there are three things to be done:
1. Implement NSURLRequest caching so that we can get the old loaded data if we're offline or on 3G (show something like FBMessenger!);
2. Fix URGENT FIXMEs, FIXMEs and TODOs (in decreasing order of importance).
3. Attempt to:
   a) Convince Porto to talk to Apple's push notification system for God's sake so we can get new grade notifications
   b) Make Porto /and/ myself suffer by having some crawling service in ac3xx's server.

WHAT'S UP NOW?

Well, the two first things above are of absolute priority for the decency of the application. While I figure out how I'm going to release this I'm going to work on that.

Regardless, the question is, how will this app be released?

As far as my understanding goes as of now, Porto has declined to buy this app from me or use my code etc. due to some weird design rules they have, yet they have authorized me to release it as I wish. I must confirm this with my contact, but if this is the case I will release this app on the App Store for a price of $0.99USD, which I find only fair given the amount of labor put on this and how much 3G you end up saving my not loading all images in Porto's homepage. Plus, it's way faster than going to the website itself, plus all of its goodies etc.

If they decline my rights to release it, I'll most likely find a way to rid myself of all stuff copyrighted by them and release it anyway. I doubt there should be major consequences.

Thanks to the effort of Guilherme Stark, I now have a pretty cool icon based on the Porto logo image, and only one asset (namely, the Grades tab bar item) is missing. I'd ask him to do those but since he's tired from working for about 8 hours in a German presentation we have for tomorrow I think I better not ask.

For now, it's this, and I hope to update this README as soon as a release is done!

Thank you all for everything.

Under development! A couple of things:
1. Huge commits. Really, huge commits. Please don't be mad at me, it's just that during these early add-a-fuckton-of-stuff development stage, I just lose track of what I'm working on and when I see I've implemented a whole new stage of what I was planning. So yeah, sorry :(

2. Huge file. Use vim and foldings to make sense out of this.

3. Send me complaints about the code! I'd like to hear from you!
